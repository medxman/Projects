This project adds on the previous projects.
There are two options when you begin the program.
1) Custom List
This part will build a custom list that the user will build, and graphs the data.
The user types in a country and will be added if the country is found in the data file.
Build with a list to make it easier to add. 
2) Random 
This part builds a graph with 5 random countries that can be randomized. It also uses mouse listener 
to change the background color when the mouse goes over the graph. If you click on the Graph at the exact pixel
the country is on, that the country name will be displayed in the text field. If you dont click a country, then
the message no country at cords x,y will appear.
