Project Proposal: Mehdi Salemi
- There will be 2 Parts to he program which the user will choose for at the start 
- User can choose random or custom
- If user chooses random, a random list of countries on a graph will appear, user 
can then randomize that list, and this part will utilize different parts of mouse listener 
and action listeener. If the graph is clicked at the exact position of the plotted country point, 
then in the text box the country name will appear, if they click somewhere else in the graph, 
the message No country at cords x,y" will appear. 
- If the user chooses custom lift, and blank graph will appear and the user can enter countries
into the text field and if country is found that it will be added to the lsit and graphed. 
The user can add up to 10 countries to the list. 
- Storyboard photo's are attached: 1 phote showing random graph and 1 photo showing the custo graph.
